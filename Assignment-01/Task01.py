#Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
#Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
# 1. Takes two numbers as input from the user.
n = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
m = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# 2. Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
# o	Addition
add = n+m
# o	Subtraction
sub = n-m
# o	Multiplication
mul = n*m
# o	Division
div = n/m
# 3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.
print("Addition: ", add)
print("Subtraction: ", sub)
print("Multiplication: ", mul)
print("Division: ", div)
